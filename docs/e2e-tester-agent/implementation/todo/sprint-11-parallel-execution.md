# Sprint 11: Parallel Execution Support

**Priority**: HIGH
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: Sprint 10 (DirectedAcyclicGraph must be implemented)
**Status**: PLANNED

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goals

Enable parallel execution of independent subtasks to improve test execution performance using the DAG implementation from Sprint 10.

---

## 📋 Key Tasks

1. Implement parallel execution in TestOrchestrator using DAG
2. Add parallelism configuration to YAML schema
3. Implement execution queue with concurrency limits
4. Add execution metrics and timing reports
5. Handle failures in parallel execution gracefully

---

## 🚀 Sprint Deliverables

- Parallel execution support with configurable concurrency
- Performance improvements (2-5x faster for independent tasks)
- Comprehensive timing metrics
- All tests passing
