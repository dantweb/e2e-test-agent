## Migration Guide

### From Pre-1.0 Versions

#### API Changes

**TaskDecomposer** - New methods for dependency management:
```typescript
// Old: Simple decomposition
const subtasks = await decomposer.decompose(task);

// New: Dependency-aware decomposition
const result = await decomposer.decomposeTaskWithDependencies(
  task,
  steps,
  dependencies
);
// Returns: { subtasks, graph }
```

**TestOrchestrator** - New state tracking methods:
```typescript
// Old: Basic execution
const result = await orchestrator.executeSubtask(subtask);

// New: With state tracking
const result = await orchestrator.executeSubtaskWithStateTracking(subtask);
// Automatic state transitions and metadata capture
```

**Reporters** - New factory pattern:
```typescript
// Old: Direct instantiation
const reporter = new HTMLReporter();

// New: Factory pattern
import { createReporter } from './presentation/reporters';
const reporter = createReporter('html');
```

#### Breaking Changes

None - all new features are additive. Old APIs remain functional.

#### Deprecations

None
